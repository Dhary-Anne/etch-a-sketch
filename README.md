# etch-a-sketch

General Info

In this project, prompted by The Odin Project course, I created an etch-a-sketch in which the user is able to create a grid by typing in a number between 1 and 100. Once selected, the grid will grow or shrink to the appropriate size. The user can then hover over the squares within the grid and watch each square change color. I have also included a reset button which resets the etch a sketch to the default 16X16 grid and clears any colors that may have been present prior.
